# MarkovChain-MusicComposition
This paper presents an approach to simulating the composition of a fugue through stochastic processes aided by rules of counterpoint. Particularly, I will investigate methods to emulate the style of J.S. Bach (1685-1750), using the fugues from the Well-Tempered Clavier, BWV 846â€“893.
